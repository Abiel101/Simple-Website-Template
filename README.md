# How To Get Started
This website is meant to be simple and easy to use. I assume you don't know much about how website and might not be able to build your own so I will make this easy so you can this work for your project.
## Must Know
For any sort of changes to images or names you will need to make sure that the browser knows where it is looking for the image or what ever source you are trying to show on your page.
You also what to make sure if you are adding any sort of image you add it to the *resources folder* so that you know where to look for this image or resource.
### Image Source
```html
<img url="resources/your-image">
```
## Project Folder
In the project folder there will be a template page so if you add ned projects to your website you are able to duplicate this file and easily add it to the grid.
Once you duplicate the file you can go in and rename the duplicated file. After its been renamed you can go in and begin to change any text.

### Code to Look for 
Most changes will be from heading, maybe groups of text of some simple link you will see these sections of code as these following tags
```html
<h1> heading 1 tag </h1>
<a href="[add url link here]"> link tag </a> <!-- this is where you change some links-->
```
## How to Setup Link
In the home page I have place a main link for the projects page but also smaller links for your top projects. All you will need to do is change the "#" to the url or the link you want it to go to.

EXAMPLE:
``` html
<a href="about-me.html">About Me</a> 
```
